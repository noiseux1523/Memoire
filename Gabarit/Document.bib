Allowing a small debt to occur is acceptable provided it is paid soon enough; not paying the debt for a longer period invites bigger troubles. Similarly, in a software project, technical debt needs to be repaid regularly to avoid its accumulation. Large technical debt significantly degrades the quality of the software system and affects the productivity of the development team. In extreme cases, when the accumulated technical debt becomes so huge that it cannot be paid off anymore, the product has to be abandoned. This chapter emphasizes the importance of the concept of technical debt, the factors that contribute to it, and its impact on software projects. "

These phenomena provoke bugs that are notoriously hard to track down: the program does not necessarily crash and the results are not necessarily obviously wrong, but often subtly inaccurate. Further use of these values can lead to catastrophic errors. In this paper, we present a dynamic program analysis that supports the programmer in finding accuracy problems. Our analysis uses binary translation to perform every floating-point computation side by side in higher precision. Furthermore, we use a lightweight slicing approach to track the evolution of errors.  We evaluate our analysis by demonstrating that it catches wellknown floating-point accuracy problems and by analyzing the Spec CFP2006 floating-point benchmark. In the latter, we show how our tool tracks down a catastrophic cancellation that causes a complete loss of accuracy leading to a meaningless program result. Finally, we apply our program to a complex, real-world bioinformatics application in which our program detected a serious cancellation. Correcting the instability led not only to improved quality of the result, but also to an improvement of the program's run time.},

In experiments, our analyser is consistently more precise than a state-of-the-art static analyser and significantly outperforms floating-point decision procedures.},

The increase of the precision of computations does not need any increase of the length of the data words. This is particularly important if hardware limits for the precision of computations exist, which is just the case for graphic processors. A history of development of the cores of graphic cards is analyzed together with the idea of general purpose computing using GPU's (GPGPU). Special attention has been paid to efficiency and precision of computations. The so-called maximum accuracy property has been analyzed and technically realized with no additional costs in hardware and computation time. The proposed approach has been tested with illustrative frequency modulated sine waveform generators.},

	abstract =	 {High confidence in floating-point programs requires proving numerical properties of final and intermediate values. One may need to guarantee that a value stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value is well bounded. This certification may require a time-consuming proof for each line of code, and it is usually broken by the smallest change to the code, e.g., for maintenance or optimization purpose. Certifying floating-point programs by hand is, therefore, very tedious and error-prone. The Gappa proof assistant is designed to make this task both easier and more secure, due to the following novel features: It automates the evaluation and propagation of rounding errors using interval arithmetic. Its input format is very close to the actual code to validate. It can be used incrementally to prove complex mathematical properties pertaining to the code. It generates a formal proof of the results, which can be checked independently by a lower level proof assistant like Coq. Yet it does not require any specific knowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus, is accessible to a wide community. This paper demonstrates the practical use of this tool for a widely used class of floating-point programs: implementations of elementary functions in a mathematical library.},

Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard, and concludes with numerous examples of how computer builders can better support floating-point.},

Unfortunately, in some (catastrophic) situations, the floating-point operations lose so much precision that they quickly become irrelevant. In this article, we review some of the problems one can encounter, focussing on the IEEE754-1985 norm. We give a (sketch of a) semantics of its basic operations then abstract them (in the sense of abstract interpretation) to extract information about the possible loss of precision. The expected application is abstract debugging of software ranging from simple on-board systems (which use more and,more on-the-shelf micro-processors with floating-point units) to scientific codes. The abstract analysis is demonstrated on simple examples and compared with related work},

We present a complete survey of a static analysis based on abstract interpretation, and a prototype implementing this analysis for C code, for studying the propagation of rounding errors occurring at every intermediary step in floating-point computations.  In the first part of this paper, we briefly present the domains and techniques used in the implemented analyzer, called FLUCTUAT. We describe in the second part, the experiments made on real industrial codes, at Institut de Radioprotection et de Su&circ;rete&acute; Nucle&acute;aire and at Hispano-Suiza, respectively coming from the nuclear industry and from aeronautics industry. This paper aims at filling in the gaps between some theoretical aspects of the static analysis of floating-point computations that have been described in [13,14,21], and the necessary choices of algorithms and implementation, in accordance with practical motivations drawn from real industrial cases.},

	ABSTRACT = {A discontinuity exists between object-oriented modeling and programming languages. This discontinuity arises from ambiguous concepts in modeling languages and a lack of corresponding concepts in programming languages. It is particularly acute for binary class relation\-ships---association aggregation and composition. It hinders the traceability between software implementation and design thus hampering software analysis. We propose consensual definitions of the binary class relationships with four minimal properties---exclusivity invocation site lifetime multiplicity. We describe algorithms to detect automatically the properties in source code and apply these on several frameworks. Thus we bridge the gap between implementation and design for the binary class relationships easing software analysis.},

	ABSTRACT = {Brooks' milestone `Mythical Man Month' established the observation that there is no simple conversion between people and time in large scale software projects. Communication and training overheads yield a subtle and variable relationship between the person-months required for a project and the number of people needed to complete the task within a given time frame. This paper formalises several instantiations of Brooks' law and uses these to construct project schedule and staffing instances --- using a search-based project staffing and scheduling approach --- on data from two large real world maintenance projects. The results reveal the impact of different formulations of Brooks' law on project completion time and on staff distribution across teams and the influence of other factors such as the presence of dependencies between work packages on the effect of communication overhead.},

	completeness with respect to the requirements, internal
	consistency, or other quality attributes) can directly affect the
	quality of, and effort required for, the implementation.We have
	created a set of �reading techniques� (so called because they
	help a reviewer to �read� a design artifact for the purpose of
	finding relevant information) that gives specific and practical
	guidance for identifying defects in Object-Oriented designs. Each
	reading technique in the family focuses the reviewer on some
	aspect of the design, with the goal that an inspection team
	applying the entire family should achieve a high degree of
	coverage of the design defects.In this paper, we present an
	overview of this new set of reading techniques. We discuss how
	some elements of these techniques are based on empirical results
	concerning an analogous set of reading techniques that supports
	defect detection in requirements documents. We present an initial
	empirical study that was run to assess the feasibility of these
	new techniques, and discuss the changes made to the latest
	version of the techniques based on the results of this study.}

	software system, the quality of its design must be evaluated
	using adequate quantification means. In spite of the current
	extensive use of metrics, if used in isolation metrics are
	oftentimes too fine grained to quantify comprehensively an
	investigated design aspect (e.g., distribution of system�s
	intelligence among classes). To help developers and maintainers
	detect and localize design problems in a system, we propose a
	novel mechanism � called detection strategy � for formulating
	metrics-based rules that capture deviations from good design
	principles and heuristics. Using detection strategies an engineer
	can directly localize classes or methods affected by a particular
	design flaw (e.g., God Class), rather than having to infer the
	real design problem from a large set of abnormal metric values.
	We have defined such detection strategies for capturing around
	ten important flaws of object-oriented design found in the
	literature and validated the approach experimentally on multiple
	large-scale case-studies.}

	Bad smells are a set of design problems with refactoring
	identified as a solution. Locating these bad smells has been
	described as more a human intuition than an exact science. This
	paper addresses the issue of identifying the characteristics of a
	bad smell through the use of a set of software metrics. Then by
	using a pre-defined set of interpretation rules to interpret the
	software metric results applied to Java source-code, the software
	engineer can be provided with significant guidance as to the
	location of bad smells. These issues are addressed in a number of
	ways. Firstly, a precise definition of bad smells is given from
	the informal descriptions given by the originators Fowler and
	Beck. The characteristics of the bad smells have been used to
	define a set of measurements and interpretation rules for a
	subset of the bad smells. A prototype tool has been implemented
	to enable the evaluation of the interpretation rules in two case
	studies.},
